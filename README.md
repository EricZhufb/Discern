# Discern: Discourse-Aware Entailment Reasoning Network for Conversational Machine Reading (EMNLP 2020)

This repository is the implementation of our EMNLP 2020 Paper [Discern: Discourse-Aware Entailment Reasoning Network for Conversational Machine Reading](https://yifan-gao.github.io).

`Discern` achieves new state-of-the-art results on [ShARC conversational machine reading benchmark](https://sharc-data.github.io/leaderboard.html) (May 2020).

Code and models will be released before the end of October. Stay tuned!
